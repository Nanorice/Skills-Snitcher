Our people are Kind, Collaborative, Humble and Entrepreneurial - these values are important to us and are the foundations of our inclusive culture. We like to work with thoughtful people who are passionate about what they do and enjoy using their skills to solve real-world problems.

The Role

Working within our Finance team (currently three people), you'll play a key part in supporting this function as our business grows, alongside our Chief Financial Officer, Finance Manager, and Finance Associate.

Forecasting financial information, including cash flows, P&L and regulatory capital;
Overseeing the accounts, audit and tax submissions for Quadrature, QCF (a registered charity) and associated entities;

We believe our role is to disrupt the current trajectory, support those that have already or have the potential to demonstrate progress, and design and implement high-impact approaches. You'll bring knowledge and experience of the charity sector to this role, and you can expect your responsibilities here to include financial and tax reporting for QCF, as well as financial due diligence on charities identified by the foundation for grants.

If you have a background in management accounts and charity auditing, are interested in automating routine work, and want to support us in our efforts to combat the climate emergency, we'd love to hear from you!

Working Here

We're fortunate enough to have a fantastic office in the Cheesegrater building with excellent views of London.

Job Posting 01-May-2020, 11:36:21 AM

The Bank of England is the UK's central bank. Our mission is to deliver monetary and financial stability for the British people.

The Bank of England is a diverse organisation, made up of approximately 4,000 people – each committed to public service and dedicated to promoting the good of the people of the United Kingdom by maintaining monetary and financial stability.

The Markets Directorate promotes monetary and financial stability by leading the Bank's market operations, and by using our presence, expertise and influence in financial markets to inform and shape the Bank's policy decisions and priorities.
The Markets Directorate includes 6 Divisions which are:
Sterling Markets
Foreign Exchange
Market Intelligence
Financial Risk Management
Middle Office
Markets & Banking COO
Department Overview
The Sterling Operations team sits within the Sterling Markets Division. The team is responsible for managing and implementing the monetary policy and liquidity insurance facilities which make up the Bank’s Sterling Monetary Framework.

These responsibilities include:

Planning and running a range of market-facing operations, including Quantitative Easing (QE) gilt and corporate bond auctions, Indexed Long Term Repo operations, and Discount Window Facility (DWF);
Working on the development of possible future monetary policy or liquidity insurance tools/operations;

Analysing the performance and effectiveness of our operations and, where relevant, identifying improvements.

Monitoring and analysing market developments in (particularly UK rates and bank funding and liquidity markets), including analysing market reactions to key economic and monetary policy developments;

Contributing to the execution and management of the Bank’s Sterling Bond Portfolio (SBP) via which the Bank invests its capital and generates income for its core operations.
Most recently the Sterling Operations team has been contributing directly to the Bank’s Covid-19 response through a wide range of operations and policy evelopment:
Monitoring markets, understanding the drivers of market developments and helping formulate the Bank’s policy response;

Implementing the MPC’s asset purchases of £200bn government bonds and sterling corporate bonds;

Job description
Dealer-analysts on Sterling Operations team take on a full range of market-facing responsibilities, including setting up and running auction operations for monetary policy and liquidity insurance purposes, preparing and publishing Monetary Policy announcements, executing gilt trades for the Sterling Bond Portfolio, and providing pre and post-operation commentary and analysis to senior management. Full training is provided on operational tasks, and you will be part of a close-knit and supportive team. Prior operational experience is a positive, but not essential, but a good understanding of financial markets and a desire to learn is.


Dealer-analysts lead on pieces of policy and analytical work relating to the sterling markets and how the Bank’s balance sheet and operations can be used to achieve the Bank’s objectives. This involves developing and implementing policy recommendations, identifying areas for improvement, and managing and educating stakeholders. Dealer-analysts will be expected to have strong analytical and drafting skills and a track record in producing analysis and reports for an executive-level audience.

Dealer-analysts are also required to monitor market developments (particularly UK rates and bank funding and liquidity markets), and to actively participate in market intelligence gathering activities. This market intelligence in turn helps brief the Bank’s policy Committees (the Monetary Policy Committee, Financial Policy Committee, and Prudential Regulation Committee) and can help influence important decisions on the market interventions we make how we run our existing operations or simply (but importantly!) helps us understand and interpret recent market moves.


Overall, dealer-analysts' time tends to be split fairly evenly between operational, analytical and market intelligence/monitoring tasks, although there is some opportunity to flex this based on individual strengths and preferences.

Cambridge Associates is a leading global investment firm. We work with non-profit institutions, pension plans, and private clients to build investment portfolios that help them meet their philanthropic goals, pensioners’ obligations, or personal endeavors. Our goal is to meet clients wherever they are in the investment process. We offer a variety of services to complement those needs, from acting as an outsourced investment office to providing access to our world- class digital research platform. Committed to independence since our founding more than 40 years ago, we are motivated only by what is best for our clients.

We have a global team of outstanding investment advisors and an extensive research platform to support them. With more than 1,200 employees in nine locations around the globe, we are constantly looking to discover new ideas for our clients’ portfolios.

IAs are part of CA's Global Investment Services (GIS) division, and work in one of four practice areas: Endowments & Foundations, Pensions, Private, and Middle East & Africa (MEA). Each IA is generally responsible for 8 to 12 clients and handles several projects at once. While every IA is responsible for arranging his/her priorities in order to meet deadlines, there is a strong tradition of teamwork and cooperation among members of the Investment Analyst class to help manage the workload. Although the position involves quantitative analysis, there is also a strong qualitative component as IAs work to describe market conditions and relay investment recommendations to clients.

In addition to client work, Investment Analysts often choose to join auxiliary teams, which provide support for the broader firm and allow individuals to develop skills outside of traditional client work. IAs also have the opportunity to apply for junior management roles such as the Team Leader position. Team Leaders manage work flow, conduct performance reviews, and oversee ongoing development and training for a team of six to eight Analysts.This position will join the Global Investment Services (GIS) division within the Pensions Practice.

You look forward to building the detailed financial model of how one of our potential investments will actually make money. You are excited to crack the market sizing assumptions provided by entrepreneurs and unpack their assumptions. You are just cynical enough to recognize when a CEO hasn't really figured it out, and confident enough to place a bet when you're sure they have.
Partner support. You will be the jack-or-jill-of-all-trades for our London office. You'll work closely with our London-based Venture Partner and lead on operational efforts. You won't mind spending time coordinating calendars, updating databases, or being the go-between communicator between our two offices.

The actuarial area of the practice offers a wide range of services in the actuarial field, including (but not limited to):


Pricing & reserve calculations





Helping insurers ensure they charge the correct premiums for their products (e.g. car insurance) to reflect the risks they are taking on and ensuring they hold the correct amount of financial resources to both comply with regulation and give comfort to policyholders that their claims will be paid.


Capital & reinsurance modelling





Looking at all (financial and non-financial) risks faced by an insurer to calculate the amount of additional financial backing needed to cover the volatility of these risks. This involves carrying out modelling of different scenarios to ensure the amount of resources held is sufficient to survive different environments that the company may find itself in the future.


M&A due diligence





Analysing, from a commercial, strategic, financial or actuarial standpoint, the operations on a potential sale or purchase of an insurer.


Liability estimation





Using actuarial techniques to calculate the amount which a company should hold on its balance sheet so the claims of policyholders can be paid as they become due.

The role will be focussed on people in the actuarial space, working on capital modelling, regulatory and financial reporting and due diligence, whilst also lending these skills to commercially relevant challenges faced by the larger insurance firms in the UK.


You will be staffed on a variety of client projects, have client interaction through telephone calls and meetings and be treated as a full member of the GIS team.


You will be gain experience in working with leading software that is used in many actuarial firms across the industry.


You will have the opportunity to interact with both qualified and student actuaries to experience a first-hand account of what the requirements are to become an actuary, both professionally and personally.


Some of your day to day tasks may include:

Aid in the delivery of core actuarial risk management projects - exceeding client expectations by demonstrating strong problem-solving skills to address project needs
Learning how to manage complex models and research - encompassing a wide range of different insurance regulations
Work effectively with a diverse group of colleagues and clients
Perform analysis working both as an individual and in teams
Perform data checks on work done by colleagues to ensure a quality final product
Develop an understanding of generic business strategy and the components that underpin high performance

Qualifications & Experience

Think again.

Founded in 2010, we're a small tech business run by programmers.

Now 80 people and growing, we're a close-knit team who enjoy learning and collaborating closely on interesting problems. Our people are Kind, Collaborative, Humble and Entrepreneurial - these values are important to us and are the foundations of our inclusive culture. We like to work with thoughtful people who are passionate about what they do and enjoy using their skills to solve real-world problems. We don't expect the people who join us to be experts or have existing knowledge of our industry; we care more about curiosity, attitude and mindset.

Our friendly and diverse people have joined us from the likes of Apple, Facebook, Google, Yandex and tech startups. We're a small business, so everyone has the opportunity to own their work from day one, whilst being surrounded by people who are happy to help.

THE ROLE

We analyse large amounts of data in a way that's impossible for humans and look to bring automation to everything we do. As an Execution Analyst (EA), you'll help make this possible.

Working in a team of overnight EAs (currently four, with five others covering daytime hours), you'll be monitoring our trading activity, providing real-time support by understanding how our strategies are performing, and suggesting improvements wherever you spot them. You'll have the opportunity to develop your market knowledge in this role, and your insights here will have real value to the rest of the business, keeping us up-to-date on what's going on with our trading, and how we might look to optimise this. You'll also collaborate with other teams across the business, enabling key developments such as the launch of new regions.

As an EA, you can expect to programme as part of your role, so some experience with this skill (regardless of programming language) would be great. Don't worry if you're not too familiar with programming, though: we're more than happy to support your learning and development here.

This is an overnight role which will consist of an 8-hour shift occurring between the hours of 10pm and 10am. You can expect some variation here, to give you an insight into different markets.

If you're inquisitive, analytically minded, and want to learn more about programming and the world of finance, we'd love to hear from you!

WORKING HERE

We're fortunate enough to have a fantastic office in the Cheesegrater building with excellent views of London. We offer competitive compensation and a comprehensive benefits package, much of which is focused around wellbeing, health and learning. Our large breakout area is full of food, drinks and games - it's also where we host monthly all hands meetings, events and many of our socials. Professional development is very important to us and we work hard to support people's progress. You will have access to a vast range of development opportunities such as funded training, workshops, reading groups, postgrad study, coaching and as many free books as you'd like.

THERE'S SO MUCH THAT WE WANT TO BUILD AND WE'VE ONLY JUST BEGUN. IF YOU LIKE THE SOUND OF US WE'D LOVE TO HEAR FROM YOU! YOU CAN SUBMIT YOUR APPLICATION BELOW AND ONE OF OUR TEAM WILL RESPOND TO YOU WITHIN A FEW DAYS."

Westminster City Council is the proud custodian of the heart of the nation’s capital – we host some of the most vibrant communities, from the world-renowned Soho to richly diverse Church Street.

Our City for All vision is to provide world class services to the residents and communities we serve. We will do this by creating a greener and cleaner city, vibrant communities and one of the best connected, most technologically advanced cities in the world.

The role
This is a bold vision. And as our lead officer for responsible procurement, you’ll play a pivotal role in making it happen. You’ll put the council at the forefront of key policy issues such as Social Value, London Living Wage and tackling Modern Slavery.

You’ll work across the council and the entirety of its £700m annual procurement spend to ensure that all of our contracts deliver environmental, social and economic benefits throughout their whole lifecycle. This agenda is at the forefront of the council’s ambitions for the city and close to the heart of the Leader of the Council – so this work will be high profile and receive support from the very top of the organisation.

Your background

You’ll have a passion for the power of procurement to unlock wider value for communities – and plenty of experience of having delivered measurable, visible outcomes.

You’ll be a creative thinker who will push the boundaries of what’s possible. But your advice will be firmly grounded in a superb understanding of the relevant legislation, what others are doing and well informed by evidence.

We’ll be looking to you to provide outstanding advice on the key policy issues and to ensure the council is kept at the cutting edge of best practice – not just regionally or nationally, but positioning Westminster as one of the leading cities anywhere in the world.

A great place to grow

So you can expect to enjoy agile working and targeted personal and professional development.

It is an extremely exciting time here at HM Courts and Tribunals Service. We are currently undertaking a first-of-its-kind Change Programme aimed at delivering pioneering modernisation of judicial services, exploiting digital technologies to deliver services that better serve the public. With over £1 Billion of funding this is the most ambitious programme of its kind anywhere in the world, working to ambitious timescales this is an exciting and rewarding portfolio to be part of.


Reform provides the opportunity to place citizen needs and expectations at the very heart of HMCTS. People will be able to participate with confidence, be treated with respect and understand what is happening at all stages of their case. Transformation will reduce cost and increase confidence of the judiciary, delivery partners and stakeholders in the justice system whilst delivering benefits both to HMCTS and to the taxpayers. Importantly, service transformation is key to ensuring that HMCTS is on a sustainable financial footing for the future, and will enhance the UK Justice system as a global leader.


As part of the Change Directorate you will be at the forefront of creating and implementing change in our world-leading justice system. The Programme is ambitious and we need resilient, resourceful and adaptable people, with programme delivery experience, to make it happen. To support us on this journey, we’re expanding the team and now are looking for an exceptional talent to join the Delivery Team at HMCTS.


Role Overview:


The G7 Portfolio Planning Lead role provides you with the unique opportunity to be central to the planning and delivery of the HMCTS Reform Programme.


HMCTS is an agency of the Ministry of Justice, and operates as a partnership between the Lord Chancellor, Lord Chief Justice and the Senior President of Tribunals. The HMCTS Reform Programme is a £1bn transformation portfolio reshaping the justice system around the needs of all those who use it, by simplifying and streamlining our processes, and providing people with new digital routes into court and tribunal services.


The opportunities offered will enable you to access professional development opportunities including an enhanced and tailored development plan, and access to the unique Government Project Delivery Professional Network, not to mention your participation in some of the country’s most ambitious projects.


The G7 Portfolio Planning Lead will lead the work to establish clear and coherent plans for delivery of the reform portfolio, and ensure these products are available and used throughout reform to guide the delivery of the programme. The portfolio is constantly having to keep its plans under review, particularly in the current climate, and the role is exciting and requires the holder to be adaptive.


This will involve working across the portfolio with individual programme management offices, as well as with programme directors, to build out the critical paths to the major milestones, and delivery of benefits.

You will be responsible for running the regular planning sessions with the programme directors, and ensuring that the decisions made in this forum are reflected throughout the programme plans by working with the wider planning community.


Through the critical path planning work, you will establish the critical dependencies across the portfolio. You will be responsible for monitoring and managing these dependencies. This involves impacting change requests and delayed milestones against the dependency log to ensure that issues are escalated quickly and efficiently.


You will also be responsible for maintaining the various planning products for a broad number of stakeholders including Change SMT, Portfolio Board, the Legal Professionals framework and other groups.


You will often have to deal with difficult and novel situations and use creative thought to develop possible courses of action, to evaluate risks and to make judgements on the most appropriate solution taking into account internal and external requirements. In this role you will communicate with a wide range of people,


You will act independently on day-to-day planning issues and take a strategic view across the portfolio for planning purposes, providing reports and advice to help inform decision making when requested.


Key Responsibilities:


People & Leadership – Communicate with, and manage, a broad set of stakeholders ensuring buy-in for your initiatives. Support business areas to take decisions and take the lead in their area of expertise.
Key milestone planning – You will lead the work on the establishment of the plan and key milestones, and their continuous evolution. This will include ensuring buy in from the various programme managers and PMOs.
Portfolio Prioritisation – You will support the Head of Performance and Planning (G6) in establishing an updated portfolio prioritisation framework which can be used when needed, but also as part of the business case refresh process to ensure the portfolio is prioritised against its strategic objectives to ensure the best possible delivery of reform.
Business case longer term planning – Through the business case refresh you will be responsible for establishing the longer timeframe reform plan. This will involve consulting across the programmes to establish a long-term plan to the end state of reform.
Dependency management – Through the critical path planning you will derive the critical path dependencies. You will be responsible for logging these dependencies and understanding the impact of change requests and missed milestones.
Planning materials – You will hold the planning materials centrally, advocating their user across the portfolio by working alongside the knowledge management lead.

Other duties


The post holder is required to work in a flexible way and undertake any other duties reasonably requested by line management which are commensurate with the grade and level of responsibility of this post.

Fitch Group is a global leader in financial information services with operations in more than 30 countries. Fitch Group is comprised of: Fitch Ratings, a global leader in credit ratings and research; Fitch Solutions, a leading provider of credit market data, analytical tools and risk services; and Fitch Learning, a preeminent training and professional development firm. With dual headquarters in London and New York, Fitch Group is owned by Hearst.
Fitch Ratings is a leading provider of credit ratings, commentary and research. Dedicated to providing value beyond the rating through independent and prospective credit opinions, Fitch Ratings offers global perspectives shaped by strong local market experience and credit market expertise. The additional context, perspective and insights we provide help investors to make important credit judgments with confidence.
As a global credit rating agency, Fitch Ratings gauges the ability of entities and instruments to meet their credit obligations. Investors and financial market participants rely on multiple sources, and the credit rating – indicating how an issue or transaction is likely to perform over time – is one of their key inputs. In this way, we help investors to better understand potential credit risks.
Department overview:
The Sustainable Finance (SUF) group has analysts in London, New York, and Hong Kong. The main role of the Group is to provide ongoing support for the analytical teams and champion ESG both within Fitch and with external parties, as well as coordinating and producing sector and thematic research both internally and externally. The group has additionally been recently tasked with conceiving of, and developing, new product ideas related to ESG for both the ratings business and the broader Fitch Group. The Group acts as the voice of Fitch on all sustainable risk issues, providing views and opinions on Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) credit risk issues.
Members of the SUF group are expected to continually expand and deepen their sector knowledge in this fast changing area. Members of the team are expected to be readily available and responsive to internal analysts as well as external investors and media on all sector and thematic ESG credit risk issues. The green product team is expected to keep up to date with market developments and trends both within ratings and in the broader ESG universe.
Like many groups within Fitch Ratings, the SUF group places great importance on interaction with its colleagues around the world and other areas of the firm. This collaboration ensures a consistent application of Fitch’s strategic ESG initiatives across analytical groups, successful competitive positioning, and a coordinated group approach to the overall dynamics of ESG risk in the industries in which Fitch operates. Members of the green product team will be required to not only work independently on concepts and ideas, but also to work proactively with other business areas in surfacing and pursuing opportunities to develop market leading solutions to ESG problems.
Responsibilities:
The Director (D) will initially need to develop an in-depth knowledge of Fitch’s approach to ESG and then work with internal and external data sets to surface potential ways to support the development of Fitch’s ESG franchise. The D will work with other green product team members to develop potential products and services to support Fitch’s ratings analysts work, and / or products for broader use by ESG focused investors. Execution, oversight and leadership of specific ESG development projects or project streams will be an integral part of the role.
Qualifications and Experience:
Over six years’ experience in credit/finance/ESG analysis, is essential. Candidates with a strong academic background in ESG will also be considered.
Previous experience in developing ESG products and services will be an advantage
Some experience of credit ratings and / or asset management credit analysis is desirable
Demonstrable knowledge of ESG themes, particularly climate change and other environmental themes, would be a significant advantage.
Strong analytical and quantitative skills.

ABOUT THE ORGANISATION

Climate change is one of the world’s most pressing challenges; one that requires technology, policy, markets, finance, and investment to work in concert. In recent years, technological progress has been remarkably positive, while policy has been slower to react.
